# Gauntlet Clone

A simple browser-based game inspired by the classic arcade game Gauntlet.

## Features
- Infinite randomly generated levels
- Decaying health mechanic (find food to survive!)
- Enemies (grunts, ghosts) and enemy spawners
- Locked doors and keys
- Vanilla JavaScript and Canvas API

## Controls
- **W, A, S, D**: Move up, left, down, right
- **Arrow Keys**: Shoot in a direction

## How to play
Destroy spawners to stop the flow of enemies. Pick up food to replenish health, and keys to open locked doors. Find the exit (a purple square marked 'EXIT') to proceed to the next, larger level.

## Build Instructions
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev` to play locally.
3. `npm run build` to build for production. The resulting output will be in the `dist` directory.
